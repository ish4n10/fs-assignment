**Layout:** `main.py` (entry), `config.py`, `interview.py`, `voice.py`, `storage.py`, `data/` for transcripts and logs.


### Info

The prompts are generated by the help of the translations from Interviews in Youtube Videos, these translations were passed to an LLM (gpt) and asked to generate a proper prompt, this is just a PoC.


# Task 2 - Frontend UI with Mock Data

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Where components and pages live

| What you see | Where the code is |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Landing** (4 steps: name, role, experience, company) | `app/page.tsx` - main component, `STEPS` config, and the card/input/Enter button UI |
| **Resume upload page** (drop resume, filter pill, Upload button) | `app/components/landingPage.tsx` - `ResumePage` |
| **Job list page** (“X Jobs found”, scrollable list of job cards) | `app/components/landingPage.tsx` - `CompanyPage` |
| **Job detail page** (single job: description, responsibilities, skills, Apply) | `app/components/landingPage.tsx` - `JobDetailPage` |
| **Notification preferences page** (bell, dropdown, Continue) | `app/components/landingPage.tsx` - `NotificationPreferencesPage` |
| **Plan selection page** (Free ₹0 / Paid ₹399, Continue) | `app/components/landingPage.tsx` - `PlanSelectionPage` |

**Routing / flow**  
`app/page.tsx` holds the app state(onboarding -> resume -> company ->  job detail -> notification prefs -> plan selection). It imports and renders `ResumePage`, `CompanyPage`, `JobDetailPage`, `NotificationPreferencesPage`, and `PlanSelectionPage` from `app/components/landingPage.tsx`.

- Mock data used by the UI: `app/mock-data.json` (job list, job details, notification options, plan benefits).

## Getting Started

# Task 3, Resume site review 

## Rezi.ai
### First Impressions and UX
I’ll be honest: seeing "AI" in the title looks a little like a trap. There’s a lot of noise online saying AI builders are a trap, so I went in skeptical. However, the dark theme and the amount of features won me , it looks professional and makes you want to click around just to see if the tools can actually give you something that will help you.

### Key Features and Strengths
The AI Toolkit: Beyond the builder, having a Job Search and an AI Interviewer in one place is a huge plus.
The Chatbot: This is the standout. It actually helps you identify where your resume is falling short. It feels like a collaborative audit.

### Weakness
It needs a "Inspiration Engine." While the AI is smart, it would be much better if it pulled bullet point inspiration from real world good resumes. 
It can be like
"People in your role often highlight X, did you do something similar in your project?" 
It keeps the user something to look out to instead of diving in rabbithole of ai

## Resume.io
### First Impressions and UX
At first, it feels like "just another" builder. The UI is fine, but it’s a bit generic. They’ve gone for a LinkedIn-style approach with "percentage complete" bars and profile stats. It’s functional, but it doesn't exactly feel like it should.

### Key Features and Strengths
 All-in-one system: It’s great if you want to stay in one tab. Having job matches and recommended courses in makes it feel like a career hub.

### Weakness
The marketing for their "Expert Help" is a massive turn-off. Using a hook like 
"Struggling to get a job? Get expert help"
 basically tells the user that the product they’re currently using might not be enough to get them hired.
