interviewer: Hi there! Today we'll be doing a Product Design case study. For our session, let's focus on this: How would you design a new feature for Spotify that helps users discover music based on their current mood?
user: so if I if I have something related to users mode in their uh let's say database let's say like what kind of uh what kind of music the user listens I can just have them on board let's say I have user that he listens to sad and happy music so I can just sort out based on his previous listening history like what kind of band or music uh artist he listens I can sort out the exact mode of the songs because I would already have it in my database
interviewer: That's an interesting starting point. Can you elaborate on how you would actually *determine* a user's current mood?
